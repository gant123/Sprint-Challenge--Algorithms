#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) - Linear Time - it has one loop.

b)0(n^2) - Quadratic Time - it's has a loop nested in a loop

c) 0(n) - Linear Time - it's a recursion that keeps calling itself and reducing each call by 1

## Exercise II

using binary search start at the middle floor drop egg if it breaks move down to the next floor if it doesn't break move up to the next floor

runtime: 0(log n) since it's a binary search
